        <h1>Addendum</h1>
        <p>For my javascript portion of the assignment, I decided to tackle a simple problem in which I could use resources in case I was still lost.</p></br>
        <p>After I came across a sum calculator that was made from javascript, I thought it suited the layout of the page so well. Also, have ever just needed to have something add two numbers real quick?</p></br>
        <p>However, without all the hocus pocus with other operations? Well, I thought that this calculator brought simplicity but also a nice button at the same time.</p></br>
        <p>It was hard to write at first, since I knew nothing about javascript and I was confused about the formatting. Luckily, there are many websites that showed me how to do it</p></br>
        <p>Another problem I had was figuring out how to put each content into its own specific panel, but after some experimenting, I figured out that I can break down each section and put the material in between</p></br>
        <p>each section.
